A class is a template or a blueprint that describes the supported behavior and state of all objects of its type, while an object itself is an instance of a class.

Think of the class as the instruction manual or cooking recipe while an object is what is made when following said instruction manual or reciple.

Public methods can be accessed by any other code in the same assembly or another assembly that references it. Meanwhile, a private method can only be access by code found in the same class or struct file.

Let's say we have a Program.cs file and a Class1.cs file. Public methods in Class1 can be accessed from Program.cs, but private methods can only be accessed from inside Class1.
